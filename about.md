# Hello World

Hi I'm GS. I've been around in the tech industry since the dotcom bubble days. I've done project management, software architecture, and presales. Currently I'm leading a team of talented software engineers to deliver full-stack software solutions using agile development methodology for clients.

Although my job focuses more on managing people nowadays, I still try to keep in touch with my technical skills. My primary interest areas are in software engineering, security and DevOps. I'm constantly looking for the perfect application development platform.

This blog is where I keep my notes, and talk about my thoughts on the various stuff I'm looking at or working on.
